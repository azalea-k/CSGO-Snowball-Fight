# CSGO-Snowball-Fight
Small script to provide snowballs in CSGO, with 1hp each and nothing but knife.

Server commands provided via .cfg file, to allow infinite snowballs and remove guns. Place in /cfg/ folder, and exec snowballs.cfg
This is required to remove starting pistols, provide infinite ammo, enable all talk, and tweak round times.
